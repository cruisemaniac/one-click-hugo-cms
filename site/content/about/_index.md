## Hi there!

My Name is Ashwin, known around the internet as cruisemaniac. I am a DevOps, Infra and Cloud engineering leader who likes to help people build, migrate and get going with their technology solutions on major cloud providers like AWS, Azure and GCP. I love working with tech - I run my own DNS and email servers.

I'd love to say hi!

## Work

I work as an Infrastructure and cloud consultant helping startups scale from the first 1000 to the first million users!

## Books

I'm currently shuttling between [The Manager's Path](https://amazon.in/dp/B06XP3GJ7F/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) by Camille Fournier and [Psycho-Cybernetics](https://www.amazon.in/Psycho-Cybernetics-Updated-Expanded-Maxwell-Maltz-ebook/dp/B00SI02BW4/ref=sr_1_1) by Dr. Maxwell Maltz.

## Community

I hang out a lot around twitter and a few slack groups, the most notable being [Remote Indians](https://remoteindian.com/) and [Devs and Hackers](http://devup.in/).

I'm running a Masterclass to help Engineering teams scale up on Serverless tech with AWS Fargate. Check out and sign up for my [Fargate Masterclass](https://fargate.cruisemaniac.com). 

## Social Media

I'm not active on facebook. I am fairly active on twitter, you can see the link to it at the bottom of this page, or you can view my github profile to see if there's any repo's I've starred that you might like. I've also got my linkedin profile down there so we can connect!
