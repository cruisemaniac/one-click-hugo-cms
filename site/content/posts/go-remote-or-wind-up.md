title: Go Remote or Wind up!

The whole #covid19 pandemic is an amazing opportunity to gear up for the next level.

For every single organization looking to hire for the best employees out there, here's just 2 words: Go Remote!

Treat this international situation as an opportunity to hire remotely. And Here's why: A person who says he / she will work remote has already ticked off a lot of boxes - 

1. They're self motivated
2. They learn on their own
3. They can work with a broad requirement and dig around to get work done.

These are some of the main qualities that you look for when you hire. All you need to do is hire a person ready to work remotely, enable them and trust that work WILL BE DONE.

When you want someone to work with you and they do not have to be in your office, your talent pool increases exponentially - You now have the entire world of talent to tap into!

This is an experiment at a global scale. Be part of it. Benefit immensely!

I'd love to help you / your organizations go remote. Email me at mail@cruisemaniac.com and we can get chatting!
