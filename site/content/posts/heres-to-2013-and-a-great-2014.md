title: Here's to 2013 and a great 2014
---

2013 was an amazing year in many respects! Worked on more things than before - learnt a ton of new things...

Infrastructure management - I got my hands dirty with something i've always wondered what it was. Knowing how to organize your infrastructure, sizing, planning, creating new machines, the cloud and yes, Amazon EC2 as well!

Got better at automating software delivery - helped improve processes at work! A tiny little tool that I wrote has run with 0 downtime for the last year! Okay… there was a downtime of about 5 minutes when the root password expired :-P

Got my daughter start her schooling - at the very same place that I studied! *personal best*

Travelled - both within India and Outside - The visit to Copenhagen was beautiful! Cold, Freezing, yet beautiful - thanks to the amazing bread and cheese they have there!

In all, this was a year that I _re-discovered_ myself - revelations like I can run for a kilometer before my lungs start burning OR walk for 6 kilometers before I can feel my knees start to complain were interesting!

Fell down, got hurt, got up, got running again! And thats the quick run up that was 2013.

Here's wishing you all a wonderful 2014 ahead… and if I may, I'll leave you with this
