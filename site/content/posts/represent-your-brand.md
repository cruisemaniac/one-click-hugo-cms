title: Represent your brand

<p>When you talk to your customer, you&#8217;re representing the brand that the customer pays to use.</p>

<p>When the customer walks into your brick and mortar establishment, the last thing you should be giving him is a blame on another branch of your brand for having screwed up his experience.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re doing no good to the customer, doing no good to your brand and you&#8217;re effectively wasting his time and spoiling your reputation.</p>

<p>How about you quickly figure out how to get things going in the right direction?</p>

<p>Without blaming your counterparts&#8230;
Without blaming the customer for a sorry start to a bright and sunny Monday morning&#8230;
Without blaming the hot, scorching Chennai Sun&#8230;</p>

<p>Dear Axis bank, I love you folks and probably still love the way you get things done for me. I think I&#8217;ll let this <em>ONE</em> bad experience pass!</p>

<p>Everyone makes mistakes! The only problem people have is with collectively owning up a mistake and working towards fixing it!</p>
