title: Starting Off 2018
---

2018 has started off slow, but steady. I've promised myself to NOT set any resolutions to keep up / follow for 2018. I've also promised myself to concentrate on one thing and ONE thing only.

> Get things done. One thing at a time.

Well, in that regard, I've finally gotten around to setting up my Home server - It now hosts the following:

1. My personal document store
2. My mail server / MX (Huge shout out to the ACT tech team for getting this done quick) - separate blog post coming in soon
3. My web server + test bed

Things to come soon:
1. DNS resolver - WIP
2. Plex Media server for home
3. Other non-descript stuff that I can work with

I've also gotten back to cycling with much more earnest than before. I have a target to achieve this year and while this is not a resolution, It would be awesome to hit that number!

73km of Unknown done. ;-)

I think this is how I've always intended to live life - Take it as it comes!
