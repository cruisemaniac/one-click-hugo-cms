I got off facebook today. My account isnt active anymore. There's a point to which you can stand those ToS changes that Facebook makes and then breaks for their benefit.
To have random ads showing up in my feed is just not worth anymore! And sitting there isnt giving me any money either.

I'm no big Security and Privacy advocate but if Facebook knows when you're taking a leak, you should definitely be concerned!

If you ARE really interested in deleting your facebook account, and should you be interested to know why I did this, read up more [here][1].

I'm still on twitter. And I'm trying out diaspora... Lets see how that turns out!

As a parting note, let me leave you with this thought:

> Don’t confuse privacy with secrecy. I know what you do in the bathroom, but you still close the door. That’s because you want privacy, not secrecy. ([From I have nothing to hide. Why should I care about my privacy?][2])
