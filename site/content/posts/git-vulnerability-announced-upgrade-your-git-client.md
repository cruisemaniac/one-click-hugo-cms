title: Git vulnerability announced! Upgrade your git client
---

Git just announced a new release ([ver 2.2.1][1]) of the git client that fixes a [vulnerability][2] affecting all git users on Windows and Mac OSX operating systems. Github says this:


> The vulnerability concerns Git and Git-compatible clients that access Git repositories in a case-insensitive or case-normalizing filesystem. An attacker can craft a malicious Git tree that will cause Git to overwrite its own `.git/config` file when cloning or checking out a repository, leading to arbitrary command execution in the client machine. Git clients running on OS X (HFS+) or any version of Microsoft Windows (NTFS, FAT) are exploitable through this vulnerability. Linux clients are not affected if they run in a case-sensitive filesystem.
> 
> We strongly encourage all users of GitHub and GitHub Enterprise to update their Git clients as soon as possible, and to be particularly careful when cloning or accessing Git repositories hosted on unsafe or untrusted hosts.

If you're using homebrew, the process is very very simple:

`brew doctor`

`brew update`

`brew upgrade git`

You can download the latest clients for [windows][3] and [OSX][4] from the links provided. They have been patched for the vulnerability already.
