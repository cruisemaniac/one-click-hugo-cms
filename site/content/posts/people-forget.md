title: People Forget
---

The most important offering at a restaurant is not the food. Its the experience while at the restaurant that makes a person go visiting again. Or swoon about it on social media! Good food is just, "so to speak", the _icing on the cake!_

Thats why I pay you a premium for the experience!

When you forget something as essential as a customer's order, the tastiest of dishes at your establishment takes a back seat over a spoilt evening for the people at the table!

Apologize genuinely, Make quick amends and move on.

In the days of social media and instant feedback, its as easy to keep a good face as it is to tumble and fall.

_Buon App&eacute;tit!_
